    <p>When a child holds something, they grasp it firmly in their hands. This action requires coordination and strength in their fingers and palms. Children often hold onto objects for comfort, security, or to explore their surroundings.</p>
    <p>Holding objects also helps children develop their fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.</p> 
    <p>Encouraging children to hold different objects can aid in their physical and cognitive development.</p>
